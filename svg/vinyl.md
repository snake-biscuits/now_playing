# Vinyl `.svg`s

Measurements taken from wikipedia
Proportions of details are just guesses
I went with what looked nice to me

Using `inch -> pixel` units I came up with for `svg_tool`

Lots of room to expand into
Could use as a base to generate thumbnails

Or an OpenGL rasteriser
Re-implementing as a shader wouldn't be too hard, since it's radial shapes
Could also do label mask, pseudo-random noise & track thicknesses that way
